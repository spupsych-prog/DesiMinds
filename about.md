# About Me

Iâ€™m Purva Sreekanth, a mental health professional dedicated to supporting Indians living abroad through culturally sensitive, personalized guidance.

Living in a new country can bring excitement but also emotional challenges such as stress, loneliness, cultural adjustment, and identity struggles.

My clients often find that local therapy models don't fully understand their values and cultural backgrounds. I provide:

- Support during adjustment and cultural transitions  
- Assistance with relationship and family challenges  
- Help managing anxiety, mood struggles, and confidence issues  
- Guidance for personal growth during life changes  

My approach is practical, empathetic, and tailored to your unique cultural context.
