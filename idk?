<section class="intro">
  <p>You don’t have to explain why family expectations matter or why guilt sometimes overshadows self-care. I know your story because I share your culture. I’m here to help you write the next chapter—on your terms.</p>
  <p>Why struggle to find mental health support in a system that doesn’t understand your background? I bring you care from India that is designed to fit your time zone, your budget, and your cultural comfort zone.</p>
